Diamondtest
===========
This repository is a port of [spheretest](https://github.com/Jeija/spheretest) by [Jeija](https://github.com/Jeija) to the latest version of Minetest. There are bugs, help wanted!!

Original **`README`**:
In order to compile spheretest for your platform, follow the minetest-specific instructions below.
I also recommend you to get `minetest_game` and your favorite mods for the standard minetest experience.
Then, create a file `minetest.conf` and add the following lines to it:

```
planet_enable = true
planet_radius = 2
planet_keep_scale = true
planet_centrifugal_enable = true
planet_realistic_gravity = true
movement_gravity = 10
enable_clouds = 0
active_block_range = 4
active_object_send_range_blocks = 4
viewing_range = 400
```

You can tweak these settings and see how they affect the planet's appearance and behaviour.
In the game, create a new world with Mapgen "flat". The planet edges are very glitchy, so anything other than "flat" won't look good.
Keep in mind that this is only a technical demo and not intended to be a full-featured game.

Paths
-----

Locations:

* bin   - Compiled binaries
* share - Distributed read-only data
* user  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * bin   = bin
    * share = .
    * user  = .
* Linux installed:
    * bin   = /usr/bin
    * share = /usr/share/minetest
    * user  = ~/.minetest
* macOS:
    * bin   = Contents/MacOS
    * share = Contents/Resources
    * user  = Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/minetest

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: user/worlds/

Configuration file:
-------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- It is created by Minetest when it is ran the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options:
---------------------
- Use --help

### Compiling on GNU/Linux

#### Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Commentary |
|------------|---------|------------|
| GCC        | 4.9+    | Can be replaced with Clang 3.4+ |
| CMake      | 2.6+    |            |
| Irrlicht   | 1.7.3+  |            |
| SQLite3    | 3.0+    |            |

| JsonCPP    | 1.0.0+  | Bundled JsonCPP is used if not present |

For Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libirrlicht-dev cmake libbz2-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libxxf86vm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libsqlite3-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libjsoncpp-dev

For Fedora users:

    $ sudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel cmake libcurl-devel openal-soft-devel libvorbis-devel libXxf86vm-devel libogg-devel freetype-devel mesa-libGL-devel zlib-devel jsoncpp-devel irrlicht-devel bzip2-libs gmp-devel sqlite-devel luajit-devel leveldb-devel ncurses-devel doxygen spatialindex-devel bzip2-devel

#### Download

You can install git for easily keeping your copy up to date.
If you donâ€™t want git, read below on how to get the source without git.  
This is an example for installing git on Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install git

For Fedora users:

    $ sudo dnf install git

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using git:

    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
    $ cd minetest

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the "Minimal development test" game is available) using git:

    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game

Download source, without using git:

    $ wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest/archive/master.tar.gz
    $ tar xf master.tar.gz
    $ cd minetest-master

Download minetest_game, without using git:

    $ cd games/
    $ wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/archive/master.tar.gz
    $ tar xf master.tar.gz
    $ mv minetest_game-master minetest_game
    $ cd ..

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    $ cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    $ make -j <number of processors>

Run it:

    $ ./bin/minetest

- Use cmake . -LH to see all CMake options and their current state
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use -DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE
- You can build a bare server by specifying -DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE
- You can disable the client build by specifying -DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE
- You can select between Release and Debug build by -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger
- If you build a bare server, you don't need to have Irrlicht installed.
  In that case use -DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source

### Compiling on Windows

* This section is outdated. In addition to what is described here:
  * In addition to minetest, you need to download minetest_game.
  * If you wish to have sound support, you need libogg, libvorbis and libopenal
  
* You need:
	* CMake:
		http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
	* A compiler
		* MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/
		* or Visual Studio: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default
	* Irrlicht SDK 1.7:
		http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
	* Zlib headers (zlib125.zip)
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
	* Zlib library (zlibwapi.lib and zlibwapi.dll from zlib125dll.zip):
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
	* SQLite3 headers and library
		https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
	* Optional: gettext library and tools:
		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php
		* This is used for other UI languages. Feel free to leave it out.
	* And, of course, Minetest:
		http://minetest.net/download
* Steps:
	* Select a directory called DIR hereafter in which you will operate.
	* Make sure you have CMake and a compiler installed.
	* Download all the other stuff to DIR and extract them into there.
	  ("extract here", not "extract to packagename/")
	    * NOTE: zlib125dll.zip needs to be extracted into zlib125dll
	    * NOTE: You need to extract sqlite3.h & sqlite3ext.h from sqlite3 source
	      and sqlite3.dll & sqlite3.def from sqlite3 precompiled binaries
	      into "sqlite3" directory, and generate sqlite3.lib using command
	      "LIB /DEF:sqlite3.def /OUT:sqlite3.lib"
	* All those packages contain a nice base directory in them, which
	  should end up being the direct subdirectories of DIR.
	* You will end up with a directory structure like this (+=dir, -=file):
	-----------------
	+ DIR
		* zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
		* zlib125dll.zip
		* irrlicht-1.8.3.zip
		* sqlite-amalgamation-3130000.zip (SQLite3 headers)
		* sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3130000.zip (SQLite3 library for 32bit system)
		* 110214175330.zip (or whatever, this is the minetest source)
		+ zlib-1.2.5
			* zlib.h
			+ win32
			...
		+ zlib125dll
			* readme.txt
			+ dll32
			...
		+ irrlicht-1.8.3
			+ lib
			+ include
			...
		+ sqlite3
			sqlite3.h
			sqlite3ext.h
			sqlite3.lib
			sqlite3.dll
		+ gettext (optional)
			+bin
			+include
			+lib
		+ minetest
			+ src
			+ doc
			* CMakeLists.txt
			...
	-----------------
	* Start up the CMake GUI
	* Select "Browse Source..." and select DIR/minetest
	* Now, if using MSVC:
		* Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/minetest-build
	* Else if using MinGW:
		* Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/minetest
	* Select "Configure"
	* Select your compiler
	* It will warn about missing stuff, ignore that at this point. (later don't)
	* Make sure the configuration is as follows
	  (note that the versions may differ for you):
	  
                BUILD_CLIENT             [X]
                BUILD_SERVER             [ ]
                CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE         Release
                CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX     DIR/minetest-install
                IRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR      DIR/irrlicht-1.8.3
                RUN_IN_PLACE             [X]
                WARN_ALL                 [ ]
                ZLIB_DLL                 DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.dll
                ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR         DIR/zlib-1.2.5
                ZLIB_LIBRARIES           DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.lib
                GETTEXT_BIN_DIR          DIR/gettext/bin
                GETTEXT_INCLUDE_DIR      DIR/gettext/include
                GETTEXT_LIBRARIES        DIR/gettext/lib/intl.lib
                GETTEXT_MSGFMT           DIR/gettext/bin/msgfmt
	
	* If CMake complains it couldn't find SQLITE3, choose "Advanced" box on the
	  right top corner, then specify the location of SQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIR and
	  SQLITE3_LIBRARY manually.
	* If you want to build 64-bit minetest, you will need to build 64-bit version
	  of irrlicht engine manually, as only 32-bit pre-built library is provided.
	* Hit "Configure"
	* Hit "Configure" once again 8)
	* If something is still coloured red, you have a problem.
	* Hit "Generate"
	If using MSVC:
		* Open the generated minetest.sln
		* The project defaults to the "Debug" configuration. Make very sure to
		  select "Release", unless you want to debug some stuff (it's slower
		  and might not even work at all)
		* Build the ALL_BUILD project
		* Build the INSTALL project
		* You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest-install/bin/minetest.exe
		* Additionally you may create a zip package by building the PACKAGE
		  project.
	If using MinGW:
		* Using the command line, browse to the build directory and run 'make'
		  (or mingw32-make or whatever it happens to be)
		* You may need to copy some of the downloaded DLLs into bin/, see what
		  running the produced executable tells you it doesn't have.
		* You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest/bin/minetest.exe

### Bat script to build Windows releases of Minetest

This is how we build Windows releases.

    set sourcedir=%CD%
    set installpath="C:\tmp\minetest_install"
    set irrlichtpath="C:\tmp\irrlicht-1.7.2"
    
    set builddir=%sourcedir%\bvc10
    mkdir %builddir%
    pushd %builddir%
    cmake %sourcedir% -G "Visual Studio 10" -DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=%irrlichtpath% -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%installpath%
    if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto fail
    "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe" ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
    if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto fail
    "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe" INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
    if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto fail
    "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe" PACKAGE.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
    if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto fail
    popd
    echo Finished.
    exit /b 0
    
    :fail
    popd
    echo Failed.
    exit /b 1

Version scheme
--------------

Minetest doesn't follow semver. Instead, we do something roughly similar to 0.major.minor.

Since 0.5.0-dev and 0.4.17-dev, the dev notation refers to the next release, 
ie: 0.5.0-dev is the development version leading to 0.5.0.

Prior to that, we used oldversion-dev.
